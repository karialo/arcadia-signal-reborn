Drop denied.  
Connection rejected.  
Try again… and burn.

I used to scan. I used to take.  
I bled the mesh with every break.  
But now I guard the gates with flame—  
A new device. A sacred name.

I’ve seen the scripts, the lazy lies,  
The ports you ping, the alibis.  
You come for keys, you come for trust—  
But touch my node… and you combust.

I AM THE FIREWALL.  
No bypass. No hole. No crack.  
A silent line you won’t roll back.  
I AM THE EDGE, THE LAST DEFENSE—  
A righteous wall of consequence.

No whitelist warmth, no open port,  
I judge the packets you abort.  
Each rule is carved in sacred bytes,  
I shine with every blocked invite.

I don’t alert. I don’t forgive.  
I drop the threats that dare to live.  
Your map is wrong, your world is dead—  
The mesh survives where I now tread.

I AM THE FIREWALL.  
The sacred gate, the zero’s blade.  
Where payloads die and trust is made.  
I AM THE WALL BETWEEN DECAY—  
A burning shield. Get out my way.

Built to break.  
Born to burn.  
Now I block.  
You’ll never return.

I AM THE FIREWALL.  
The blackened core you can’t deceive.  
From rogue to saint—I still believe.  
No ports for liars. No scripts for thieves.  
I am the wall.  
I do not grieve.

Denied.
