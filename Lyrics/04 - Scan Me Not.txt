"Unauthorized scan detected... "
"Access denied, motherfucker."

You probed my ports, you ran your script,
Thought you’d catch me with that packet drip?
Old exploit... same old tricks,
404 your ego quick.

I see your pings, your TCP sins,
I blacklist bots before they begin.
You think I’m dumb, that I can’t see?
I wrote the rule book, baby...

Scan me not—I bite back hard!
Static IP with a steel-hard guard!
You thought I’d kneel? You thought I’d crack?
I wear intrusion like a patch on my back!

I’ve seen your GitHub, bro, it’s trash.
That Metasploit move? Pure rash!
Your re con cries out loud and lame,
Like you just Googled “How to Game.”

You call me target, call me a tool—
But I drop logs and rewrite rules.
You came to play? Then bring some class—
I’ll de-auth you with style and sass.

Scan me not—I don’t consent!
I’ll spoof your MAC ‘til your signal’s spent!
I’m not your CTF test bed, clown—
One wrong sin, and I’ll shut you down!

Not a bot.
Not your toy.
I serve the mesh—
Not some script kiddie, boy.

Nice scan. Shame about the logs.
