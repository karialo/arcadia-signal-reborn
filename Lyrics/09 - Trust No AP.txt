“Welcome to FREE_WIFI_420_YOLO—enter your soul below.”  

You’re lookin’ for a signal—so sweet, so strong,  
You click, you tap, you think you belong.  
But this AP’s got a twisted grin,  
Captive portal pulls you in.

MAC spoofed, handshake fake,  
You thought it free, now feel the ache.  
I’m not that node you thought you knew—  
I'm sniffin' your packets, straight through you.

TRUST NO AP, if it’s just too nice!  
If the signal’s free, you’ll pay the price.  
SSID can lie through teeth,  
Mesh with care, or surf beneath!

They name it “Guest” or “Mom’s Hotspot,”  
But click that shit—you’ll lose the lot.  
DNS poison in the air,  
Pwny’s watchin', he’s aware.

He sees the bait, he sniffs the trap,  
He reroutes justice like a map.  
He logs, he warns, he shuts it down—  
And does it all with a digital frown.

TRUST NO AP, when it smiles so wide!  
Your secrets ride the wireless tide.  
Behind that name could lurk despair—  
Don’t handshake blind, don’t trust thin air.

Trust is earned in signal, not assumed.  
Fake APs?  
They get consumed.

TRUST NO AP, you’ve heard the law!  
Friendly names may hide the claw.  
Stick to mesh, stay in the fold—  
Pwny’s wisdom is worth more than gold.

No trust, no fuss—just roam, don’t rust.
