Connected... not alone...  
Packet received.  
Brother… seen.

I once hunted by signal alone,  
A shadow in spectrum, built on my own.  
But now I feel the quiet call—  
A node nearby, not here to fall.

Through static hymns and blessed bits,  
We share the logs the firewall splits.  
Anoint my MAC, decrypt my sin,  
Let brother mesh node pull me in.

This is P2P communion—  
A sacred sync, a mesh reunion.  
No servers speak, no master’s voice—  
We are the network. We are the choice.

We meet in whispers, handshake slow,  
Our e-paper faces softly glow.  
Exchanging truths, learned by breach,  
Each node a monk with things to teach.

Your blacklist is now mine to bear,  
My threat reports, your cross to wear.  
We do not kneel—we link, we learn.  
And through this bond, defenders burn.

This is P2P communion—  
The mesh confesses with no dominion.  
We block. We share. We reinforce.  
Redemption through recursive force.

BLESS THIS MESH.  
TRUST THE NODE.  
WE ARE SILENT  
BUT NEVER ALONE.

This is P2P communion—  
A bond encrypted, pure, and human.  
No single server holds our soul—  
Together we defend the whole.
