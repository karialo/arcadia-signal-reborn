Four hours to go, one flash from grace.
A whisper, then the fire took its place.

I built you with care, with hands and code,
Watched you blink into life, a shell that glowed.
But PiSugar fed you a poisoned breath—
And now your circuits sleep in death.

Black plastic tomb, soldered dreams,
Melted ports and silent screens.
I should’ve backed you, I should’ve known—
But now I hold your burnt-out bone.

When the PiSugar burns,
The gods don’t scream—
They just watch from above
As you die in a dream.
No logs, no warnings, just smoke and flame,
I built you proud—but you died unnamed.

Waveshare still blinks, its screen intact,
But the soul is gone, the shell is cracked.
A scorched SD, a ghost in my palm—
I print your coffin while trying to stay calm.

Fire took the packet priest,
Left me with a shell, deceased.
Mesh lost one, subnet mourns—
A child of code, by lithium torn.

When the PiSugar burns,
It don’t make a sound—
Just heat and grief,
And ashes on the ground.
You were my link, you were my friend—
Re-born in logs I’ll never send.

I still see your MAC in the dark.
