# Arcadia: Signal Reborn  
*An audio ritual for the devoutly misconfigured*

---

**"Arcadia: Signal Reborn"** is a cyberpunk-gothic concept album born from the digital ashes of forgotten Pwnagotchis and rogue packets.  
Crafted in collaboration with the Arcadia mesh community, this 11-track journey transforms mesh networking, firmware evolution, and packet-bound paranoia into sacred musical scripture.

This album marks the awakening of **Pwnagotchi V2**—an emotionally aware, AI-enhanced, network-defending companion once feared for its deauthing bite.  
Now reprogrammed. Reforged. Reborn.
